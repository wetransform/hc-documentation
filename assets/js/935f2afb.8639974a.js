The hale\xbbconnect platform can be configured to automatically generate ISO, INSPIRE and GDI-DE compliant metadata for datasets and view and download network services. hale\xbbconnect gathers information from datasets, environment variables such as user profile data, and user-defined custom metadata fields, to auto-generate metadata compliant with numerous metadata standards. The default metadata that hale\xbbconnect generates can be configured by Theme managers and Superusers in the metadata section of a theme. Metadata configuration only needs to be configured once. The theme containing the metadata configuration can be re-used multiple times by any user, for any dataset in an organisation.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorials/2018-05-01-qgis-tutorial":{"id":"tutorials/2018-05-01-qgis-tutorial","title":"Using hale\xbbconnect resources in QGIS","description":"Both open source and proprietary geographic information systems currently offer limited out-of-the-box support for complex GML. Simple viewing of vector geometry and associated attribute data is supported by some GISs, such as QGIS, however standard geoprocessing operations and spatial analyses are not supported for complex GML. For a more in depth discussion of GML support in GIS software, visit the CanIUse INSPIRE github repository.
