haleÂ»connect currently supports the creation of dataset metadata, without requiring the upload of associated data. The metadata only workflow is not available for service metadata.

To create a metadata only theme, follow this workflow as a logged in data manager or theme manager:

1. Go to &laquo;Themes&raquo; on the main toolbar
2. Go to &laquo;Create new theme&raquo; at the bottom of the theme list
3. Select "Don't inherit" to create a theme that is not based on an existing theme.
    * This will create a blank theme with no associated feature types.
4. Enter a name for your theme. Add a description and version number if desired.
5. In the next step, Add feature types, accept the default and click &laquo;Continue&raquo;.
6. In the final step, click &laquo;Create&raquo;.

The newly created theme is displayed. The toggle *Publish metadata only* on the theme overview page must be activated. Navigate to the Metadata section of the theme to configure metadata. For more information about configuring metadata, visit the [Edit metadata configuration](../../setup-hc/edit-metadata-config/2015-02-10-theme-edit-metadata) page.
