You can associate the same transformation project with one or more themes. Add a new configuration to associate your project with an additional theme. Files in datasets that are linked to the theme are transformed to a different format and schema by means of the transformation project. A common example is to upload non-interoperable data in Shapefile format and to transform it to INSPIRE compliant GML.
