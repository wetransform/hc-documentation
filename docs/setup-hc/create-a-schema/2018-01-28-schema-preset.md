A *schema* describes the structure of a data set through the definition of types and their properties. Schemas can be imported from multiple types of data sources, such as databases, XML schema files, or even a Shapefile. They can also be created directly in hale connect using the built-in modelling tools. Hale»connect also contains a large number of schema presets, including all of the INSPIRE schemas.
