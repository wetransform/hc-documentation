## Working with a database as source data ##

hale»connect supports the use of databases as source data and requires authentication details to upload data stored in a database. To upload your files from a database click «Connect to database» and enter the following information:

* Database type (MS SQL, PostgreSQL and PostGIS are currently supported)
* Host (:Port)
* Database (Provide the database name)
* Username
* Password

hale»connect does not require a schema to use a database as source, however it does require a blank theme (i.e. a theme that does not contain any feature types). Databases can be used as source data in online transformation configurations.

## Create blank theme ##

To create a blank theme, follow this workflow as a logged in data manager or theme manager:

1. Go to &laquo;Themes&raquo; on the main toolbar
2. Go to &laquo;Create new theme&raquo; at the bottom of the theme list
3. Select "Don't inherit" to create a theme that is not based on an existing theme.
    * This will create a blank theme with no associated feature types.
4. Enter a name for your theme. Add a description and version number if desired.
5. In the next step, Add feature types, accept the default and click &laquo;Continue&raquo;.
6. In the final step, click &laquo;Create&raquo;.
