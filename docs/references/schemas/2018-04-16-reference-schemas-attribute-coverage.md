The Attribute coverage section contains a graphic representation of the occurrence of attribute values in all data sets that use this schema. This is highly helpful to determine which parts of a schema are actually used, and where there might be problems.

Click &laquo;Expand all&raquo; to view all attributes in each data set. Click &laquo;Collapse all&raquo; to collapse the attribute list. Click the chevron next to the data set name to expand and collapse each data set separately.

Attributes are visualized with a graduated color bar which classifies the occurrence of attribute values into intervals.

*	If all instances of the attribute have the same value, the graduated color bar is displayed as pale green and shows no gradation.
*	If instances of the attribute contain quantitative values, the values are classified into interval ranges and are assigned a graduated color ranging from pale green to dark green. The lowest values are symbolized in pale green and the highest values are symbolized in dark green.
*	The width of the interval is determined by the number of occurrences it contains. Intervals containing a relatively higher number of occurrences are wider than intervals with a lower number of occurrences.

Hover your mouse over the intervals in the graduated color bar to display the value, occurrences and percentage of the attribute, within the interval.
