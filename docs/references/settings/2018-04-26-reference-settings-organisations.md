The Organisations section displays a list of organisations and sub-organisations of the context you are currently active in. You can view the context currently active on your user profile page.

The search box at the top of the page allows you to filter the list of organisations. The sort order dropdown menu allows you to sort the list by name and suborganisation. Expand the dropdown menu to make a selection.

Each organisation record is displayed with the organisation icon, organisation name and number of suborganisations. Select the organisation you are interested in to view the account details.

### Superusers

Superusers have additional options available when viewing the account details of organisations; they have the ability to edit accounts details, to add existing users to the organisation and to delete organisations.

To add an existing user to your organisation, click &laquo;Add existing user&raquo; and enter the user name and email address of the user you want to invite to the organisation. Click  &laquo;Add&raquo; to send an invitation email to the user.

Superusers can also create new users and suborganisations in the Organisations section.
