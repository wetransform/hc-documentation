The Capacity section contains graphs which display data volume and service capacity point usage. The data volume graph displays the volume of data that your organisation maintains on haleÂ»connect. The services capacity graph offers two views of organisational capacity point usage. Click the &laquo;Per Organisation&raquo; button to view capacity point usage by sub-organisation. Click the &laquo;Limit&raquo; button to view the number of organisational capacity points consumed. The line turns red when the capacity limit is reached.

You can also view the number of capacity points that your organisation has, and the number of points currently used, on your organisation profile page.

The Capacity section also contains an &laquo;Export as CSV&raquo; button, which enables users to export a record of capacity point usage over a period of time. Click on the date selector to choose the time period you are interested in. Next, click on &laquo;Export as CSV&raquo; to download your file.
