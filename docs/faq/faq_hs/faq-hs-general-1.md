<h2>Why is hale»studio not starting on macOS?</h2>

If you have installed hale»studio release 4.1.0 and get the error <code>hale»studio is damaged and can't be opened</code> 
this is due to the fact that the application has not yet been notarized (please refer to this 
<a href="https://github.com/halestudio/hale/issues/908">bug description</a> for further details). 
Delete the application and follow the steps mentioned in the 
<a href="https://github.com/halestudio/hale/releases">Installation instructions</a> of the release notes.
