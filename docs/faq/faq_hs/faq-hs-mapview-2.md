<h2>Is there a way to show only instances of a selected feature type in the Map view?</h2>

Not at the moment but you have a couple of workarounds.

You can set a property that does not actually contain a geometry as default geometry in the Schema Explorer.
The default geometry can be changed by right-clicking on the desired property.

It is also possible to use the <code>Edit Style</code> in the feature type context menu to hide the feature type 
by setting its opacity to 0.
