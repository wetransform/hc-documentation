<h2>The toggles to publish services during batch upload are not available
or the publication of sub-datasets of a series fails with <code>Cannot perform operation 'Transaction': transactions are disabled by configuration</code>. What can I do?</h2>

Check if WFS publication is activated for the series theme. 
It is currently not possible to publish series without having the WFS enabled.
See the <a href="../../create-manage-datasets/create-dataset-series/2014-01-01-dataset-series">help page</a> about dataset series.
