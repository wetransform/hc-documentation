<h2>How can I access/harvest metadata of data and services published on hale»connect?</h2>

wetransform provides a catalogue service for the web (CSW) 2.0.2 for users who want to harvest metadata published on the hale»connect platform. The CSW contains both dataset and service metadata. Detailed information for the installation of an organisation CSW endpoint can be found in <a href="../../users-roles-orgs/harvesting-metadata/2015-03-07-csw">this section</a> of our documentation.

Further, we provide a harvesting endpoint for catalogue services that want to harvest metadata from the hale»connect platform. Information on how to access the harvesting endpoint can be found in <a href="../../users-roles-orgs/harvesting-metadata/2015-03-06-harvest-metadata">this section</a> of our documentation.
