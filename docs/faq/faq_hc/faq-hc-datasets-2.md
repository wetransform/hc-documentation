<h2>My data cannot be validated, because the INSPIRE schemas are not available. What can I do?</h2>

The server the INSPIRE schemas are currently hosted on is not available from time to time. Please try again in a few minutes. We are working on a solution to keep the schemas available for users if the server is not responding.
