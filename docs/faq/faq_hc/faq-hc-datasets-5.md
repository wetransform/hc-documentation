<h2>Is it possible to combine and publish shapefiles and raster data in one dataset?</h2>

Combining vector and raster data is currently only supported for gml vector files (not for shapefiles).
See the <a href="../../create-manage-datasets/create-dataset/2015-01-10-dataset-create">help page</a> about creating datasets.
