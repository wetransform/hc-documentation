A profile describes the extension of a schema through the definition of rules applied to data model elements. A profile is defined by consistency constraints and tag definitions which are applied to schema elements. A profile supports customized schema extension for domain-specific use. A data model can have multiple profiles, which can be combined and used together to achieve the desired result.
