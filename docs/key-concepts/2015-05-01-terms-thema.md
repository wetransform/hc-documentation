A theme is a re-usable configuration object used to define common settings for data set metadata, service publishing and transformation. The theme has several elements:

* A schema, defined through association with a number of types
* Display properties for the fields and types of that schema, such as aliases and styling
* A metadata configuration which defines the metadata fields that need to be provided, as well as default values and autofill rules for a high degree of automation
* An association with a transformation project that enables format conversion and schema transformation
* A configuration for an automated workflow that can be set to execute service publishing and data transformation on certain events such as an update to a data set
