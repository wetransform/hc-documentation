The Dataset series section allows you to enable the publishing of dataset series. A data set series is a collection of data sets sharing the same product specification [ISO 19115]. All files in a data set series have the same schema and the same spatial coordinate reference system. A data set series has its own INSPIRE, ISO or national metadata.

Activate the toggle *Publish aggregate services for all datasets using this theme* to add all datasets that use the theme to a series.

Series enabled themes allow users to batch upload files during dataset creation. The selection of a series enabled theme exposes a batch upload toggle, which enables users to upload a zipped folder containing zipped folders of the datasets which belong to the series. Dataset series can also be created by individual file upload.
