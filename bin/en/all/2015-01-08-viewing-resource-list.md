The data set resource list provides a hierarchical display of data set series and transformed data sets. Dataset series are identified with a 'Series' label and transformed resources are identified with a 'Transformations' label. Data set series can be expanded by clicking on the '>' sign, which displays a nested list of the datasets in the series. The data set resource list in hale»connect supports a range of filter and sorting options which enable users to quickly locate the resources they are looking for. 

Log in to hale»connect and click the Data resource tab to access the list. The tabular listing enables users to filter, sort, select and view datasets. Users have the added option to configure the column layout using the column widget.

The search bar at the top of the resource list filters data sets across all fields. The global scope button enables users to limit the scope of the data sets shown in the resource list. Global scope displays all available data sets, and the Organisation scope displays only those data sets which belong to the organisation of the current, logged in user.

The resource list can also be sorted by column. Click on the column name to sort ascending and click again to sort descending.

Select any resource in the list to navigate directly to the resource overview page.

The status column provides an overview of the system status and validation state of a hale»connect resource. Green indicates that the resources are valid and operating normally. Yellow indicates that the resources have validation warnings and are operating with errors. Red indicates that the resources have validation errors and are not operating normally. Grey indicates that the resources are not published. Click on any of the icons to navigate directly to the resource overview page, the metadata, the download services, or the view services.

The column widget at the top right enables users to configure the column layout of the resource list. Click on the widget to open the dialog. In the dialog, users can manage the column visibility of default columns, however default columns cannot be edited or deleted. Users can also manage the column properties of custom columns including column name, visibility and column content. Users have the additional option to add and delete custom columns. Custom column content is populated using the autofill assistant, which provides access to schema elements. Custom columns are populated with the data value present in the selected schema element, for each resource listing.

All changes must be saved before exiting the column widget dialog.
