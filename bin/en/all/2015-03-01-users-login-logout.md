Logging in works via the &laquo;Login&raquo; link visible on the top right of the application. Login either with your e-mail or with your user name and your password. In case you've forgotten your password, click the link &laquo;Forgot your password?&raquo;. You will then receive a new confirmation e-mail. Click on the link it contains to set a new password. This link is valid for two hours.

To log out, go to your user profile (person icon in the main toolbar) and click on &laquo;Logout&raquo;. When you close the browser or the tab, in which the application was running, you are automatically logged out.
