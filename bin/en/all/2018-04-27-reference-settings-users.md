The Users section displays a list of users who belong to the organisation, or a sub-organisation, of the context you are currently active in. You can view the context currently active on your user profile page.

The search box at the top of the page allows you to filter the list of existing users. The sort order dropdown menu allows you to sort the list by identifier, name, organisation or role. Expand the dropdown menu to make a selection.

Each user record is displayed with their personal icon, user alias, user name, organisation and user role. Select the existing user you are interested in to view their account details.

### Superusers

Superusers have additional options available when viewing the account details of users; they have the ability to edit accounts details, change user roles and to deactivate or delete users.

Superusers can also create new users in the Users section. For more information, visit the  [Add Users](https://www.wetransform.to/help/en/help-page-category-users/help-page-subcategory-users-register/2015/03/05/users-add/) section of the documentation.
