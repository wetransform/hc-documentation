A schema is a formal data model that defines types (classes of objects) and their properties. In the system, schemas can be imported from multiple types of data sources, such as databases, XML schema files, or even a Shapefile. We use schemas to validate data sets you upload to the system, and use them as a reference for the transformation projects, where they describe the source and target data structures.
