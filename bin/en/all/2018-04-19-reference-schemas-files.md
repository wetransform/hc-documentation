The Files section displays the files associated with your schema. In the Files section, you can view files, download files or export files.

To view the original files your schema was created from, click on the filename or the “Download as archive” button to save a copy of the files to your computer. This feature is only available for schemas that were initially created from a file, such as an \*.xsd or a Shapefile.

In the section below, you can export your files to several industry-standard schema formats including .xsd, .hsd, .sql, .xmi, and .lite. Click on one of the available formats to export your schema file.  This feature is always available.
