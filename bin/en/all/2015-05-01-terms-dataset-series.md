A data set series is a collection of data sets sharing the same product specification [ISO 19115]. All files in a data set series have the same schema and the same spatial coordinate reference system. It's possible to create derived data set series by means of transformation projects. A data set series has its own INSPIRE, ISO or national metadata.
